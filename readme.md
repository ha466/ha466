# 👋 Hey there — I’m **ha466**  
*Yes, that’s a username. No, I’m not asking what “ha” stands for… it’s a full-on mystery.*

## 🎮 About Me  
- Living life one commit at a time.  
- Currently leveling up in “Debug Boss Battles” and “Coffee Overflow” quests.  
- My favourite Pokémon is **Iron Thorns** (yes, I know it’s a niche flex).  
- I also enjoy watching anime — especially when the hero hits everything with one punch (looking at you, Saitama).  
- If code were a video game, I’d be grinding XP in the “Why-did-I-forget-to-git-add” zone.

## 💡 What I’m Doing  
- Building stuff, breaking stuff, fixing it (maybe), repeating.  
- Creating my digital lair where I + my trusty AI sidekick Iris dominate the web together.  
- Exploring new tech, pushing boundaries, and trying to keep the number of `TODO` comments under control. (Spoiler: control is overrated.)

## ✅ Skills & Tools  
- Languages: probably more than coffee supports.  
- Tools: Git, VS Code, endless terminal tabs, and a confusing number of browser extensions.  
- Super-power: Turning “It sorta worked” into “It definitely worked… ish”.

## 📫 How to Reach Me  
- Drop a star, fork something, open an issue with a big question mark.  
- Or you can just wave at me (virtually). I’ll wave back.  
- Beware: if you @mention me in a PR saying “why is this failing?”, you might trigger my secret mode — “Intense Rubber Duck Debugging”.
